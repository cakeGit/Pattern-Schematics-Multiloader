1.19.2-1.1.8: |
  - Updated mod links in mods.toml and the fabric.mod.json
  - Forge now has the update checker configured
  - Fixed the copycats not displaying accurately in the ponder (after I failed to cover up my laziness thanks @d4rkfl4sh)
  - Added shift control to the clone tool to help with large schematics
  - Made the schematicannon result in the proper item (previously would give Create's schematic no matter what)
  - Added an indicator when applying a non positioned schematic to a contraption deployer
  (This is a port, so this is the list of all changes from version 1.1.6->1.1.8)
1.20.1-1.1.9: |
  - Reduced visual clutter on schematic clone highlights [Example of new system](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1267781614591676426/1272539875136114820/2024-08-12_13.56.54.png?ex=66bb589c&is=66ba071c&hm=7870a62f2b19ea94babd9fd1c250ee8eaecfb8827f0b1c4dfaa08f7d3080d299&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1168&height=614)
    - This also should help to improve performance
