1.19.2-1.1.8: |
  - Updated mod links in mods.toml and the fabric.mod.json
  - Forge now has the update checker configured
  - Fixed the copycats not displaying accurately in the ponder (after I failed to cover up my laziness thanks @d4rkfl4sh)
  - Added shift control to the clone tool to help with large schematics
  - Made the schematicannon result in the proper item (previously would give Create's schematic no matter what)
  - Added an indicator when applying a non positioned schematic to a contraption deployer
  (This is a port, so this is the list of all changes from version 1.1.6->1.1.8)
